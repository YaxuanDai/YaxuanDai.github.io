# About Me

- I have been working on perception, prediction and planning algorithms for autonomous driving since 2018. Before that, I have experience on recommender system and transfer learning. Currently, my research interest mainly focus on: (1) multi-modal perception and motion understanding, (2) transfer learning for generalization, (3) large-scale autonomous mapping, with their deployment and applications to autonomous driving and broader robotics problems.

- Currently I am a R&D on Prediction at Meituan Autonomous Deliver. Before joining Meituan in 2020, I have served at Momenta.ai and DeepMotion.ai, working on shape analysis(pole/lane detection) and decision & planning.

- I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2018. During my undergraduate study, I have had several research internship finished, namely working on recommender system and time series understanding at [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition@CASIA](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/), applying transfer learning to large-scale face retrieval at [Multimedia Laboratory@CUHK](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), and developing framework toolkit at [Systems and Networking Research Group@MSRA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/).
